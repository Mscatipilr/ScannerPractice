# Scanner Practice Problems
Complete the coding practice problems below. All of these problems will test you on your Scanner knowledge! Once you are done with the practice problems, please post a link to your GitHub repository that your code is pushed to.

 

"Greeting"
Create a class called "Greeting" that accepts user input asking for the user's name.

 

Your output should look similar to this once you run your code:



 

"HelloThere"
Create a class called "HelloThere" that accepts two user inputs. The inputs will be printed as a part of a conversation that happens in your console.

 

First input comes after this question:

"Hello there! How are you doing today?"

 

Second input comes after this question:

"Wow - Interesting! Tell me more!"

 

The conversation then ends with a goodbye message!

 

Your output should look similar to this once you run your code:



 

"Superhero"
Create a class called "Superhero." The inputs will be printed as a part of a superhero's story that is printed in your console. There will be two user inputs accepted as a part of the story and you will need to use string concatenation to complete it.

 

First input comes after the following two lines:

"Let's write a story about a superhero."

"Who is the hero of our story?"

Second input comes after this question:

"What is their superpower?"

The story then prints the following lines using the inputs provided by the user:

"Here is the story:"

"There once was a superhero named (superhero's name), who had the power of (superpower)."

"As they grew older, (superhero's name) saw that the world needed them."

"(superhero's name) used their ability to (superpower) to save the world."

 

Your output should look similar to this once you run your code:



 

 

"Variable Inputs"
Create a class called "VariableInputs." The inputs will be printed as a part of the story that is printed in your console. There will be two user inputs accepted as a part of the story and you will need to use string concatenation to complete it.

 

First input comes after the following line:

"Enter a string of text: "

Second input comes after the following line:

"Enter an integer: "

Third input comes after the following line:

"Enter a double: "

Fourth input comes after the following line:

"Enter a boolean value: "

 

The following lines will be printed to the console using the inputs provided by the user:

"Your string is (string input)"

"Your integer is (integer input)"

"Your double is (double input)"

"Your boolean is (boolean input)"

 

Your output should look similar to this once you run your code:
